# Raspberry Pi Attendance Taker Robot with OpenCV

This project involves creating an attendance-taking robot using OpenCV and a Raspberry Pi. The robot is equipped with motors and wheels, and its movement is controlled by an Xbox controller. Additionally, the project features face recognition for attendance tracking.

## Components

- Raspberry Pi
- L298N Motor Driver
- 200 RPM DC Geared Motor
- Power Distribution Board
- 11.1 V LiPo Battery
- Wheels
- Chassis
- Wires
- Xbox Controller (GamePad)

## Wiring

Ensure proper wiring of the components, including connecting motors to the L298N Motor Driver and the power distribution board.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required Python packages on your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
pip install xboxcontroller
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition
```
## Usage
- Connect the Raspberry Pi to the components as per the wiring instructions.
- Connect the Xbox controller to the Raspberry Pi.
- Upload the provided Python scripts (xbox_controller_robot.py and face_recognition_attendance.py) to your Raspberry Pi.
- Run the Xbox controller script:
  ```bash
  python xbox_controller_robot.py
  ```
- Run the face recognition attendance script:
  ```bash
  python face_recognition_attendance.py
  ```
 Control the robot's movement using the Xbox controller and track attendance through face recognition.

## Image Directory for Face Recognition
Place images of individuals in the Attendance/Images directory for the face recognition system.
